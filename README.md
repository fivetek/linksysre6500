   - TX, RX, GND pins (3.3V logic).  
2. Connect your USB-UART adapter:  
   - **GND ‚Üí GND (Pin )**
   - **TX ‚Üí RX ()**  
   - **RX ‚Üí TX ()**  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not connect VCC (3.3V) (Pin 4)**.
- Board Header pins (The header pins don't come soldered to the board you have to solder them by yourself)

3. Start serial terminal at 57600 baud, 8N1. Set the environment variables in serial console.

  `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 57600`

  Boot without reset held down. Watch the console for U-Boot, and in particular, this line: *relocate_code Pointer at: 83f20000*

  Now press and hold reset, and type *1234567890 RET 4 RET*

  Set the environment variables in the serial terminal:

  `setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1`

  `setenv serverip 192.168.1.2`
