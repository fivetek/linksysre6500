   - TX, RX, GND pins (3.3V logic).  
2. Connect your USB-UART adapter:  
   - **GND ‚Üí GND (PIN 3)**
   - **TX ‚Üí RX (PIN 1)**  
   - **RX ‚Üí TX (PIN 2)**  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not connect VCC (3.3V) (Pin 4)**.
- Board Header pins (The header pins don't come soldered to the board you have to solder them by yourself)

2. Watch the console for U-Boot, and in particular, this line: *relocate_code Pointer at: 83f20000*
3. Now press and hold reset, and type *1234567890 RET 4 RET*
4. Set the environment variables in the serial terminal:

```bash
setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1
setenv serverip 192.168.1.2
saveenv
```

## üì• Step 4: Load and Boot Gargoyle (RAM)

```bash
tftpboot 0x81000000 gargoyle_1.14.0-ramips-mt7621-linksys_re6500-initramfs-kernel.bin
```

```bash
bootm 0x81000000
```
The device will boot Gargoyle from RAM (not yet written to flash).

## üíæ Step 5: Flash Gargoyle Permanently
